# Provenance — "Children, but not language models, show accelerating returns in word learning"

**What this is.** Every claim in the paper and supplement, traced to the cache object that
carries it, the script that produced that object, and the fits underneath. It doubles as
the **manifest for the repository split**: what moves to `acceleration` is what appears
here.

**How it was built.** Not by reading code. Every build script and a full render of all
three output targets were run under an R `trace()` on `readRDS`, `readLines`, `file`,
`gzfile`, `read.csv` and `readr::read_*`, logging every path opened. The manifest below is
what the build *actually touched* — 6,511 traced opens, reduced to 319 distinct project
paths. Grep had already proved unreliable: two scripts show no `fits/` reads under a regex
and plainly read fits.

**Last verified:** 2026-08-15, against `origin/master` of `standard_model_2`, where this
file was written at the split. Copied into this repository on 2026-09-18, when the
display-item numbering below was re-checked against the current supplement (unchanged).

## 1. External inputs — the complete set

The entire manuscript build, from raw fits to rendered PDF/docx, needs exactly this:

| input | files | what it is |
|---|--:|---|
| `fits/bayes_long/` | 234 | Stan bundles, summaries, draws, diagnostics, psi/child exports |
| `fits/llm/ladder_bestval_finer.csv` | 1 | CHILDES developmental ladder, 10 seeds × 18 budgets |
| `fits/llm/register_bestval.csv` | 1 | BabyLM / ClimbMix composition control |
| `fits/english_word_freq.rds` | 1 | CHILDES unigram frequencies for the exposure axis |
| `data/harmonized/input_level.csv` | 1 | per-recording input rates (BabyView, SEEDLingS, AM2018, FMW2013) |
| `paper/cache/*.rds` | 21 | committed intermediates; the manuscript renders from these alone |

**Nothing else is touched.** Not `fits/glmer_ladder`, `fits/io_anchored`, `fits/summaries`,
`fits/io_pooled*`, `studies/io_proc_glmer`, `studies/cross_sectional_demographics`,
`studies/input_estimation`, `model/`, or `data/` beyond the one CSV. That is a much smaller
footprint than the repository's 43 GB of fits suggests, and it is measured rather than
assumed.

All of `fits/bayes_long`, `fits/llm` and `fits/english_word_freq.rds` is archived publicly
at **<https://redivis.com/datasets/datapages.acceleration:a1c7>** (v1.1, 315 files,
verified by md5 after upload). v1.0 omitted `english_word_freq.rds`; v1.1 adds it as the
`word_frequencies` table, with the other three tables unchanged.

## 3. Traps — things that will bite whoever rebuilds this

**`qc_exclusion_report.R` cannot run offline.** It pulls Wordbank live and the endpoint it
uses (`https://langcog.github.io/wordbank-datapage//db_args`) currently returns 404, so it
fails outright. Its two outputs — `bayes_long_sample.rds` and `qc_spaghetti_data.rds` — are
committed, so the manuscript builds; but the sample sizes quoted in the main text and
fig. S2 cannot be re-derived from scratch until that endpoint is fixed or the script gains
a mirror fallback. `build_cache_short.R` already has one (`WB_MIRROR` →
`paper/cache/wordbank_items_en_ws.rds`) and runs offline cleanly.

**`10_perword_4pl.R` silently truncates when run bare.** Its default argument is
`c("thal_a3", "marchman_a3")` — two of five datasets. Running `Rscript
studies/bayes_long/10_perword_4pl.R` with no arguments overwrites the five-dataset cache
with a two-dataset one, and nothing errors. It must be invoked with all five slugs. (This
was found the hard way while tracing.)

**Three caches have more than one producer.** `fig2_efficiency` is written by both
`build_cache_short.R` and `04_fig2_m0_counterfactual.R`; `fig6_llm_slopes` by both
`build_cache_short.R` and the input paper's `build_cache.R` (which lives in
`standard_model_2`, not here); `si_cv_headline` and
`bayes_long_sample` are read in `_setup_shared.R`. Run order matters, and the input
paper's `build_cache.R` must not be run after the split expecting the same file.

**`fig. S1` depends on nothing.** It is a self-contained simulation with a fixed seed, so
it needs no fit and no data — worth knowing when checking whether the archive is complete.

## 4. What stays behind

The input paper keeps `paper/input_paper/`, `build_cache.R`, `build_input_cache.R`,
`studies/io_proc_glmer`, `studies/cross_sectional_demographics`, `studies/input_estimation`,
`studies/proc_dp`, `studies/io_pooled`, and the corresponding fits. Its `build_cache.R`
reads `fits/bayes_long` and `fits/llm` today; after the split it must either stop doing so
or vendor what it needs, since those directories move.

`journal/PROVENANCE.md` (data sources) and `journal/paper_models_provenance.md` (last
audited 2026-06-13) describe the **input paper** and stay with it. This file supersedes
them for anything concerning the acceleration paper.
