## 00c_prepare_forward_cv.R -- build TRAIN/TEST bundles for forward (prospective) CV.
##
## WHY. The ladder's LOO holds out ONE item response at a time. A child contributes
## several hundred responses per administration, so the held-out response stays highly
## predictable from that child's remaining responses, that word's responses in other
## children, and often the same administration. Item-level LOO therefore measures
## local interpolation, and it structurally cannot penalise an over-flexible per-child
## slope: a kappa_i that merely interpolates a child's own sittings still scores well.
##
## The honest test of an ACCELERATION model is prospective: fit on a child's earlier
## administrations and predict their LATER one. That is what this builds.
##
## Split: for every child, the final administration (by age) goes to TEST; all earlier
## ones stay in TRAIN. Children need >=3 administrations so TRAIN retains >=2 -- the
## same identifiability requirement as the main analysis (one gap = one slope with zero
## residual df). Items are held fixed across the split so item difficulties transfer.
##
## Cost note: this needs only ONE refit per (dataset, model) -- every child's last
## administration is held out simultaneously -- not K refits. PSIS cannot approximate
## it because dropping a whole administration is far too large a perturbation for
## importance weights to survive.
##
## MIN_ELIG (2nd arg, default 3) -- IMPORTANT. At MIN_ELIG=3, holding out the last of
## three administrations leaves TWO in training: precisely the regime this project
## established cannot identify a per-child slope (one gap, zero residual df), and the
## reason the main analysis requires 3+. In the shallow datasets nearly every child sits
## at exactly three administrations (Thal 637/639, Marchman 149/162, Japanese 95/96), so
## MIN_ELIG=3 tests M3 in a configuration the paper explicitly excludes. Use MIN_ELIG=4
## so training retains >=3; only Norwegian (602 children) and Smith (77) have the depth.
##
## At MIN_ELIG>3 ineligible children are dropped from TRAIN as well, not just from the
## test set, so every child in the model has an identifiable slope. Child indices are
## therefore renumbered, and the test set carries the NEW indices.
##
## TRAIN_K (env, optional) -- use only each child's FIRST k administrations for training,
## still predicting their last. This is the "does acceleration help more when we can
## actually estimate it?" ladder. Simply raising MIN_ELIG would confound the answer,
## because the sample changes at every step (Norwegian: 602 children at >=4, 495 at >=5,
## 371 at >=6, 259 at >=7), so a trend could reflect who is in the sample rather than how
## much information there is per child. Holding the sample fixed at MIN_ELIG and varying
## TRAIN_K isolates the information. The residual confound is that the extrapolation gap
## shrinks as k grows, but that applies to M2 and M3 alike and we track their difference.
##
## Usage:  Rscript studies/bayes_long/00c_prepare_forward_cv.R [suffix] [min_elig] [slug...]
##   e.g.  Rscript studies/bayes_long/00c_prepare_forward_cv.R _a3 4 norwegian
##   e.g.  TRAIN_K=3 Rscript ... _a3 6 norwegian   -> bundle_norwegian_fcv6k3.rds
## Output: bundle_<slug>_fcv.rds (min_elig 3) or bundle_<slug>_fcv<N>.rds (min_elig N>3)

## TRAIN_MODE picks WHICH k administrations to keep, and it matters more than it looks.
##   "first" -- the earliest k. Both the count AND the span grow with k, but so does the
##             proximity of the last training point to the target, so the extrapolation
##             horizon SHRINKS as k rises. That confound is directional: a shorter horizon
##             helps M3 more than M2, because M3's per-child slope error is amplified by
##             how far it is extrapolated. A rising M3 advantage would then be
##             uninterpretable -- better kappa_i, or just less extrapolation?
##   "last"  -- the k immediately BEFORE the held-out one. The final training
##             administration is always the child's second-to-last, so the horizon is
##             FIXED and only the history (count and span, hence kappa_i precision) grows.
## "last" is the clean test of MCF's question; "first" additionally answers the practical
## "what if we had followed these children for less time?", so both are worth having.
