## 10_perword_4pl.R -- one estimator, both systems.
##
## THE OBJECTION. Children are scored by a binary checklist and modelled with an IRT
## accumulator; LMs are scored by surprisal and modelled with a four-parameter logistic.
## Two different functional forms were chosen for the two systems, so part of the
## qualitative contrast may follow from that choice rather than from the learners. The
## companion worry is that the two kappas are not the same unit.
##
## THE TEST. Drop the IRT model on the child side and run the LMs' OWN estimator --
## the same four_pl_sc() applied to LM surprisal -- on child production curves. Same
## functional form, same fitting routine, same per-word unit, on both systems.
##
## WHY THIS IS A FAIR UNIT. The 4-PL s(x) = lo + (up-lo)/(1+exp((x-mid)/sc)) implies that
## p = (s-lo)/(up-lo), the fraction of the way still to go, has logit(p) = -(x-mid)/sc.
## So kappa = 0.434/sc is the slope of a LOGIT with respect to natural-log input on BOTH
## sides -- not, as is sometimes read, the slope of a bounded fraction. For the LM, p is
## the fraction of a word's surprisal reduction still outstanding; for the child, the
## fraction of mastery still outstanding, 1 - P(produce). Feeding 1 - P(produce) to the
## same routine therefore reproduces the LM computation exactly.
##
## THE ATTENUATION PROBLEM, AND WHY THE TEST IS STILL CONSERVATIVE. An LM ladder is one
## learner, so its per-word curve is a WITHIN-learner trajectory. A child's per-word curve
## can only be formed by pooling across children, and a mixture of logistic curves with
## different crossing points is flatter than any of its components. The pooled estimator
## must therefore UNDERSTATE the child's kappa. It cannot overstate it. So a child-side
## number that still greatly exceeds the LM side is a conservative result.
##
## We do not leave the size of that bias unknown. The calibration step below simulates
## responses from the fitted M3 -- known xi_i, kappa_i, delta_j -- and runs the identical
## pipeline over them. Whatever kappa comes back, against a known truth, is the estimator's
## attenuation factor, and it is what licenses reading the observed number.
